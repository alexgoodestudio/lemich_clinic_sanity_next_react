        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3">The Question You're Actually Asking</h2>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-4">
          If you're reading this, you already know something's not right. Maybe it's the sleep. Maybe it's the anger that comes out of nowhere. Maybe it's just the weight of carrying things you can't talk about. And there's one thing stopping you from calling someone: you're worried it'll show up somewhere it shouldn't.
        </p>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
          Here's the direct answer: seeking mental health treatment will not automatically cost you your clearance or derail your career. In 2017, the Department of Defense updated its security clearance policies specifically to stop this fear from keeping people from getting help. But let's get into the details you actually need to know.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3">What the 2017 Policy Actually Changed</h2>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
          The DoD recognized that the stigma around mental health was more dangerous than the conditions themselves. The 2017 changes were designed to make one thing clear: getting treatment is not a weakness and it's not a career killer.
        </p>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
          What this means in practice:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled ms-4 mb-3">
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">Going to therapy doesn't disqualify you from holding a clearance</li>
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">Your mental health is evaluated based on whether you're managing it, not whether you have a diagnosis</li>
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">Seeking treatment demonstrates good judgment, not poor judgment</li>
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">Your sessions are confidential under HIPAA, same as any other medical care</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3">What Clearance Adjudicators Are Actually Looking For</h2>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-4">
          Security clearances are about trust and reliability. Adjudicators care about whether your behavior makes you vulnerable to coercion or shows poor judgment. They're looking at things like:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled ms-4 mb-3">
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">Untreated conditions that affect your decision-making</li>
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">Lying on your SF-86</li>
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">Behavior that violates regulations</li>
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">Financial problems related to mental health issues</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
          Notice what's not on that list? Simply going to therapy. In fact, managing your mental health shows you're taking care of business—which is exactly what they want to see.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3">What Actually Happens vs. What You're Worried About</h2>
        
        <div class="mb-4">
          <p class="text-md mb-2"><strong>Worry:</strong> "If I see a therapist, my command will find out."</p>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            <strong>Reality:</strong> Your therapy is private. Commands aren't notified unless there's an immediate safety issue—like you're at risk of hurting yourself or someone else. Routine treatment stays between you and your provider.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <p class="text-md mb-2"><strong>Worry:</strong> "This will show up on my evaluations."</p>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            <strong>Reality:</strong> Your medical records are confidential. Getting treatment doesn't automatically affect your evaluations. What does affect them? Job performance. And untreated mental health issues are what actually tank performance.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <p class="text-md mb-2"><strong>Worry:</strong> "I should wait until I get out to deal with this."</p>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            <strong>Reality:</strong> Waiting lets problems get worse. The research is clear: early intervention leads to better outcomes. Plus, if you establish care while you're in, it documents your condition for VA purposes later.
          </p>

      <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3">SF-86 Disclosure: What You Need to Report</h2>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
          When you fill out your security clearance paperwork, honesty is non-negotiable. But you need to understand what actually requires disclosure:
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-md mb-2"><strong>You must report:</strong></p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled ms-4 mb-3">
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">Any hospitalization for mental health</li>
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">Court-ordered treatment</li>
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">Diagnoses that required major intervention</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="text-md mb-2"><strong>You typically don't need detailed reporting for:</strong></p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled ms-4 mb-3">
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">Regular outpatient therapy for stress, adjustment, or relationship issues</li>
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">Voluntary counseling without hospitalization</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
          If you're not sure what applies to your situation, talk to your security manager. Don't guess, and definitely don't lie.
        </p>

      </div>

      <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3">The Real Risk to Your Career</h2>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
          Let's be direct about what actually threatens your career: untreated problems.
        </p>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
          When PTSD, depression, anxiety, or relationship issues go untreated, they don't just go away. They show up in ways that do affect your evaluations:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled ms-4 mb-3">
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">Performance drops</li>
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">You self-medicate with alcohol</li>
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">You get into situations that require disciplinary action</li>
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">Your marriage falls apart</li>
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">You start thinking about permanent solutions to temporary problems</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
          These outcomes absolutely will damage your career. Getting help early prevents them.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3">What To Do Next</h2>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-4">
          If you're at Naval Station Norfolk, Joint Base Langley-Eustis, or another Virginia installation and you're dealing with combat stress, relationship problems, trauma, depression, or anxiety—we're here.
        </p>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-4">
          Your mental health is as mission-critical as your physical readiness. You wouldn't ignore a torn ACL. Don't ignore this either.

    description: "If your VA claim was denied or you need to prove service connection, a NEXUS letter might be what's missing. Here's what it is, when you need one, and how to get one that actually helps.",

      <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3">If Your Claim Was Denied, This Is Probably Why</h2>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-4">
          You know something's wrong with you. You know it started in service. The VA examiner looked at you for 15 minutes, asked some questions, and then your claim came back denied. Not because you don't have the condition. But because "service connection could not be established."
        </p>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
          This is where NEXUS letters come in. A NEXUS letter—also called an Independent Medical Opinion or IMO—is a document from a qualified provider that explains the connection between your current condition and your military service. In many cases, it's the difference between a denied claim and getting what you've earned.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3">The Three Things VA Claims Need</h2>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
          To get VA disability compensation, you have to prove three things:
        </p>
        <ol class="ms-4 mb-3">
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2"><strong>Current diagnosis.</strong> You have a documented condition right now.</li>
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2"><strong>In-service event.</strong> Something happened during your service—an injury, exposure, trauma, stressor.</li>
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2"><strong>Connection between them.</strong> Your current condition is linked to that service event.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
          The third part is usually where claims fall apart. Maybe your service records are incomplete. Maybe your condition didn't show up until years after you got out. Maybe the C&P examiner didn't understand your situation. A NEXUS letter fills that gap.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3">When You Actually Need a NEXUS Letter</h2>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
          You might need a NEXUS letter if:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled ms-4 mb-3">
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2"><strong>Your claim was denied</strong> for lack of service connection evidence</li>
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2"><strong>Your service medical records are incomplete</strong> or missing the original documentation</li>
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2"><strong>Your condition appeared years after you got out</strong>—common with PTSD, chronic pain, or other conditions that develop over time</li>
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2"><strong>The C&P examiner gave you an unfavorable opinion</strong> after a brief exam</li>
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2"><strong>You have multiple related conditions</strong> from service</li>
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2"><strong>You're appealing a rating decision</strong> and need stronger evidence</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3">What Makes a NEXUS Letter Actually Work</h2>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
          Not all NEXUS letters are effective. The VA has specific standards, and if your letter doesn't meet them, you've wasted your money. Here's what needs to be in there:
        </p>
        
        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Qualified Provider Credentials</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            The letter has to come from someone licensed and qualified to diagnose and treat your condition. For mental health claims, that means a psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social worker. General practitioners won't carry the same weight.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Complete Record Review</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">
            A good NEXUS letter shows the provider actually did the work. They reviewed:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-unstyled ms-4">
            <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-1">Your complete service medical records</li>
            <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-1">All your post-service medical records</li>
            <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-1">Your personal statement</li>
            <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-1">Any buddy statements or lay statements</li>
            <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-1">Your current symptoms and how they affect your life</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">The Magic Words: "At Least As Likely As Not"</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            This is the standard the VA uses. Your letter needs to explicitly state that your condition is "at least as likely as not" (50% or more probability) related to your service. Phrases like "could be" or "possibly" don't meet the threshold.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Medical Rationale That Actually Explains Why</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">
            The provider needs to explain their reasoning using:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-unstyled ms-4">
            <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-1">Medical research and literature</li>
            <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-1">Timeline of your symptoms</li>
            <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-1">Documented service events or stressors</li>
            <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-1">Clinical findings from their evaluation of you</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3">Common Conditions That Need NEXUS Letters</h2>
        
        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">PTSD</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            PTSD claims require proving you experienced qualifying traumatic events in service and that your current symptoms stem from those events. This is especially important for Military Sexual Trauma (MST), where service records often don't document the trauma.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Depression and Anxiety</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            These often develop from service stress or trauma, or they're secondary to other service-connected conditions (like chronic pain leading to depression). A NEXUS letter establishes these connections.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Sleep Disorders</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            Insomnia, nightmares, sleep apnea—common in veterans and often linked to PTSD or service-related factors. Many veterans don't realize these are claimable conditions.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Substance Use Issues</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            If your drinking or drug use started or got worse because of service-related trauma or stress, that connection can be documented.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3">NEXUS Letters vs. DBQs: What's the Difference</h2>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
          These are two different things that serve different purposes:
        </p>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
          <strong>DBQ (Disability Benefits Questionnaire):</strong> A standardized form that documents your current condition and severity. It helps determine your rating percentage.
        </p>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
          <strong>NEXUS Letter:</strong> A narrative opinion explaining how your condition connects to service. It helps establish eligibility in the first place.
        </p>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
          You might need both, but they're addressing different parts of your claim.
        </p>
      </div>

            NEXUS letters cost $180 per letter. This is out-of-pocket—not covered by insurance or TRICARE. But when you consider that a successful claim can mean substantial monthly compensation and VA healthcare access, many veterans find it's worth the investment.

          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            Save copies of all medical records, statements, VA correspondence, and claim documents. More documentation is always better than less.

          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            When describing your symptoms, don't minimize. Explain exactly how your condition affects work, relationships, and daily activities. "I'm having some trouble sleeping" doesn't convey the same thing as "I sleep 2-3 hours per night, wake up multiple times, and struggle to stay awake at work."

        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3">You Survived Deployment. Why Is This So Much Harder?</h2>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-4">
          You did your time. You handled things most people can't imagine. You're back home, where you're supposed to feel relief. Instead, you feel like you're failing at things that should be easy. Work feels pointless. Your family doesn't understand you. The structure that kept you functional is gone, and nobody prepared you for how disorienting that would be.
        </p>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
          Research shows 44% to 72% of veterans experience high levels of stress during transition, and over 60% of post-9/11 veterans report difficulty adjusting to civilian life. You're not broken. Transition is legitimately one of the hardest things you'll do.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3">Why Civilian Life Hits Different</h2>
        
        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">The Structure Is Gone</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            In the military, someone tells you when to wake up, what to wear, where to be, what your mission is. You know your role. You know the hierarchy. You know the rules. Civilian life doesn't work that way. Nobody's giving you a purpose or a schedule. You're supposed to figure it out yourself, and after years of operating within a clear structure, that ambiguity is exhausting.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Your Identity Took a Hit</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            Loss of military identity is one of the biggest sources of stress for transitioning veterans. You were a Marine, a Sailor, a Soldier. That meant something. Now you're... what? An employee? A student? Those don't carry the same weight. When people ask what you do, saying "I work at Home Depot" doesn't feel like it captures who you are. You lost the tribe, the mission, the thing that defined you.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Nobody Gets It</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            Many veterans report feeling resentment toward civilians who complain about trivial problems. Your coworker's stressed about the office thermostat. Your brother-in-law thinks his commute is hard. Meanwhile, you're dealing with memories that keep you up at night, and you can't explain why their problems feel insulting. The cultural gap between military and civilian life is real, and it's isolating.

        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">The Skills Don't Translate</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            You can lead a team under fire. You can make critical decisions with incomplete information. You can function on no sleep. None of that shows up on a civilian resume. Employers don't know what "squad leader" means in practical terms. Your experience feels devalued, and you're starting from scratch in a world where your accomplishments don't count.

      <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3">The Mental Health Piece Nobody Warned You About</h2>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
          A 2016 survey found 53% of newly separated veterans reported chronic physical conditions and 33% reported chronic mental health conditions. The most common issues: chronic pain, sleep problems, anxiety, and depression.
        </p>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-4">
          Here's what makes it worse: mental health problems often emerge or become more serious after discharge, not during service. You might have been fine while you were in. The symptoms showed up when the adrenaline stopped and the structure disappeared.
        </p>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
          PTSD, depression, and anxiety don't just affect your mood. They affect your ability to work, maintain relationships, and function day-to-day. And because you're trying to prove you're fine, you don't address them until they've created bigger problems.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3">Why "Just Adjust" Doesn't Work</h2>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-4">
          People who've never served love to tell you to "give it time" or "be grateful you're home." That advice is useless because they don't understand what you're dealing with. Transition isn't about patience. It's about rebuilding your entire sense of self while managing symptoms nobody can see.
        </p>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-4">
          The stress of transition can trigger or worsen mental health conditions. Financial distress is common among transitioning veterans, and levels of depression and PTSD symptoms are significantly higher than population norms. You're dealing with multiple problems simultaneously—identity loss, financial pressure, relationship strain, and mental health symptoms—and they're all feeding into each other.

          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            If you're dealing with service-connected mental health conditions, document them now. <a href="/blog/va-disability-nexus-letter-veterans-guide" class="text-decoration-none" style="color: #0066cc;">NEXUS letters</a> can establish service connection for conditions like PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Getting your VA disability rating isn't just about compensation—it's about accessing long-term healthcare and validating that what you're experiencing is real.

        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Find Your People</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            Many veterans report that having a network of other veterans who understand what they went through is crucial for transition. You need people who don't require explanations. Who get the dark humor. Who understand why certain things are triggers. Civilian friends and family can be supportive, but they can't replace that connection.

          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Create New Structure</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            You won't get military-level structure in civilian life, but you can build your own. Routine helps. Physical training helps. Having goals helps. The structure won't be handed to you anymore, but you can create it deliberately.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Don't Wait Until It's a Crisis</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            More than half of veterans with mental illness don't receive treatment, and over 90% of those with substance use disorders don't get care. Waiting until you lose your job, your marriage falls apart, or you're in legal trouble makes everything harder. Getting help early prevents those outcomes.

        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-4">
          Your spouse says you're not the same person they married. You snap at your kids over nothing. Intimacy feels impossible—either you're not interested or you can't be vulnerable enough to connect. You're sleeping in separate rooms. You're drinking more. And when your spouse tries to talk about it, you shut down or blow up.
        </p>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
          You know something's wrong. You just don't know how to fix it. And everything you've tried—"communication," date nights, "giving it time"—hasn't worked. The gap keeps getting wider.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3">Why This Happens to So Many Veteran Couples</h2>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-4">
          Veterans with PTSD are more likely to experience relationship problems than veterans without PTSD. This isn't about you being a bad partner. PTSD affects how you experience emotions, how you respond to stress, and how you connect with other people.
        </p>
        
        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Emotional Numbing</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            Veterans with PTSD often can't feel love or happiness the way they used to, which makes it difficult to show affection. Your spouse interprets this as you not caring, but it's a symptom. You're not choosing to feel numb—your brain is protecting you from overwhelming emotions by dulling all of them.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Hypervigilance and Irritability</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            You're constantly scanning for threats. You can't relax. Small things—traffic, loud noises, your kid leaving a light on—trigger disproportionate reactions. Research shows veterans with PTSD exhibit more hostility, dysphoria, and criticism toward partners during conflicts. You're not trying to be an asshole. Your nervous system is stuck in combat mode.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Avoidance</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            When your spouse tries to talk about problems, you shut down or leave. Not because you don't care, but because emotional conversations feel threatening. Your brain treats vulnerability the same way it treats danger. So you avoid, which makes your spouse feel abandoned, which makes the problem worse.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Trust and Intimacy Issues</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            Veterans with PTSD report more concerns around intimacy and lower sexual interest. Intimacy requires vulnerability, and vulnerability feels dangerous when you're hypervigilant. Physical intimacy problems aren't about attraction—they're about feeling safe enough to let your guard down.

        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3">What Your Spouse Is Dealing With</h2>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-4">
          Spouses of veterans with PTSD often develop secondary traumatic stress (STS)—symptoms similar to PTSD that develop from living with someone who's traumatized. They're not just frustrated with you. They're dealing with their own mental health impact from your symptoms.
        </p>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
          Your spouse is probably:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled ms-4 mb-3">
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">Walking on eggshells to avoid triggering your anger</li>
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">Taking on more household and parenting responsibilities because you can't handle them</li>
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">Feeling isolated because they can't talk to anyone who understands</li>
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">Dealing with their own anxiety, depression, or anger</li>
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">Wondering if they should leave or if that makes them a bad person</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
          One military spouse said: "Family and friends are so glad my husband has me for support. But who supports me when I need it?" Your spouse needs help too, but nobody's checking on them.

          <p class="text-md mb-2"><strong>"Just communicate better."</strong></p>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            Communication skills don't fix PTSD symptoms. You can learn to use "I statements" all you want, but if you're emotionally numb or hypervigilant, those techniques won't address the underlying problem.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <p class="text-md mb-2"><strong>"Give it more time."</strong></p>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            Couples typically wait six years before seeking relationship therapy, and by then the problems are often severe. Time doesn't heal untreated PTSD. It lets patterns get worse.

          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            Avoidance is a PTSD symptom, not a solution. The longer you wait, the more damage accumulates. Your spouse's resentment builds. Your kids learn dysfunctional patterns. The gap widens until it feels impossible to bridge.

          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            Understanding PTSD helps, but it doesn't solve the problem. Your spouse can read every article about PTSD and still feel hurt when you're emotionally unavailable. Knowledge without treatment doesn't fix the relationship.

          <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
            You can't fix relationship problems without addressing the underlying PTSD symptoms. <a href="/blog/therapy-military-career-security-clearance" class="text-decoration-none" style="color: #0066cc;">Treatment for PTSD</a> helps reduce irritability, emotional numbing, hypervigilance, and avoidance. When your symptoms improve, your relationship has a chance to improve.

          <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
            The VA has begun offering couples and family counseling specifically for PTSD. Not every couples therapist understands how PTSD affects relationships. You need someone who gets military culture and trauma-informed care.

          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Support for Your Spouse</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            Your spouse needs their own support system. They can't be your only source of support while simultaneously dealing with the impact of your symptoms. Military spouses need to be included in treatment planning and have access to their own mental health resources.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Be Honest About What's Happening</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            Some military spouses find it helpful to separate their partner from the PTSD symptoms—to recognize when PTSD is driving behavior rather than their partner's actual feelings. This isn't about making excuses. It's about understanding what you're actually dealing with so you can address it.

        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
          Don't wait until:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled ms-4 mb-3">
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">Your spouse has given you an ultimatum</li>
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">You're sleeping in separate rooms permanently</li>
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">Your kids are showing behavioral problems from the tension</li>
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">You or your spouse is having an affair</li>
          <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">The relationship is already past the point of repair</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
          By the time couples seek therapy, they've typically been distressed for six years. The earlier you address problems, the better your chances of fixing them.

        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-4">
          Your relationship problems aren't about being a bad spouse. They're about untreated PTSD symptoms affecting how you connect with the people you love. Your spouse's frustration isn't about not understanding military service. It's about living with someone whose symptoms make them feel invisible.
        </p>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-4">
          This is fixable, but not on your own. Not by waiting. Not by trying harder at the same things that haven't worked. You need professional help from people who understand military trauma and relationship dynamics.
